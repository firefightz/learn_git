1. Development & Coding

Write clean, efficient, and scalable code in languages like Java, Python, Go, or Node.js.
Develop and maintain RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints for microservices.
Implement serverless computing solutions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Step Functions).
2. Cloud & Infrastructure Management

Deploy and manage microservices on AWS (ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.).
Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.
Optimize performance and cost-efficiency of cloud resources.
3. CI/CD & Automation

Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or AWS CodePipeline.
Automate deployments with containerization tools like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
Ensure smooth and reliable software releases with blue/green and canary deployments.
4. Monitoring & Troubleshooting

Monitor system health using AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Datadog.
Debug production issues using AWS X-Ray, logging tools (ELK stack, CloudTrail, or Fluentd).
Improve system reliability with error handling, retries, and failover strategies.
5. Security & Compliance

Implement IAM roles, security groups, and encryption to protect applications.
Conduct security assessments and ensure compliance with best practices (e.g., OWASP, CIS benchmarks).
Use AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store for managing sensitive data.
6. Collaboration & Agile Practices

Participate in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and code reviews in an Agile/Scrum team.
Collaborate with DevOps, QA, and product teams to refine requirements and improve system architecture.
